# 🏥 Hospital Database Management System (DBMS)  

## 📌 About This Project  

This project is a **Hospital Database Management System (DBMS)** developed as part of the **DATA1046B - Data Management I: Structured Data** course at **New Brunswick Community College**. The project involves **SQL-based data management**, including **table creation, data insertion, views, and complex queries** to support hospital operations such as **doctor specialization, patient management, treatments, and appointments**.  

This repository contains:  
- **SQL Scripts** for database creation, data insertion, views, and queries.  
- **ER Diagram** to visualize the database schema.  
- **Query Execution Screenshots** demonstrating successful SQL execution in **MySQL Workbench**.
